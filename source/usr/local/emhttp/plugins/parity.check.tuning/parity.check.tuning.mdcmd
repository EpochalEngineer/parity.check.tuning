# This is a custom version of the Unraid standard 'mdcmd' command that 
# adds the capability to detect exactly when certain events were initiated.
# This is to try and detect the cases where a parity check was initiated
# manually rather than as a standard scheduled task.  All original functionality
# is retained so it should not affect normal operation.
