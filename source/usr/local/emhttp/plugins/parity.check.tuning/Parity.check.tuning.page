> Write more verbose entries to the syslog file to help with debugging any problems using this plugin might encounter.<br><br>Messages written to the syslog by this plugin are identified by the fact that they are shown as coming from **Parity Check Tuning**.   With the **Disabled** option set these will only be a small number of messages indicating that this plugin has taken some action.<br><br>Setting this option to **Enabled** will result in additional entries being written to the syslog that give more information on what is happening when this plugin is running. They show how some of the internal operation of how the plugin is functioning. These additional entries are identified by the fact that they will have the word **DEBUG** added to the start of messages.  Some users (particularly those who have not used this plugin before) may like to use it to see more detail on how this plugin operates, but it is not expected that this option will be left enabled in normal running<br><br>Finally there is an additional setting of **Testing** that is only intended for use by the developer but is left here for convenience.  It will write even more verbose messages to the syslog but these are not likely to be interesting (or even meaningful) to the avaerage user.  These messages will have the word **TESTING** added to the start of messages. <br><br>Feedback is welcome as to whether it is worth introducing any intermediate option that outputs information type messages on the plugins activity, while omitting some of the lower level detail that is aimed at diagnosing any problems that might be encountered while the plugin is running.
