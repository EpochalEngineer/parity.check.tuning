####Parity Check Tuning###
A simple plugin to fine-tune the operation of an Unraid parity check so it can automatically be run in increments. 

This will be of particular use to those who have large parity drives so that a full parity check can take a day or more to complete.   By using this plugin the parity check can be run in smaller increments that are scheduled to run when the array would otherwise be idle.

More details can be found in the plugins [Support thread](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/78394-plugin-parity-check-tuning/) in the Unraid forums.

A template to allow this plugin to be installed via the Unraid Community Applications (CA) plugin is available in my Unraid-CA-Templates repository
